    <h1 style="text-align:center;">Structural Diverging and Converging</h1>
    <p>
      The structural subsystem underwent a systematic diverging and converging design process to evaluate enclosure integrity, component fixation, and internal layout organization. During the diverging phase, multiple attachment and assembly strategies were explored to assess trade-offs between accessibility, durability, and reproducibility.
    </p>

    <p>
      Structural divergence focused on three primary aspects: attachment of the breadboard to the enclosure, attachment of the top and bottom enclosure components, and internal component layout. Several fixation strategies for the breadboard were considered, including unfixed placement, temporary fixation methods such as tape or glue, and mechanical fixation. While unfixed and temporary methods offered ease of access and reduced complexity, they introduced unacceptable risks of component movement and inconsistent reliability during handling.
    </p>
    <p>
Similarly, enclosure attachment methods were explored through unfixed placement, snap-fit assembly, and mechanical fastening using screws. Unfixed configurations provided rapid access for debugging but lacked structural integrity. Snap-fit assemblies offered a clean, hardware-free solution but raised concerns regarding long-term durability and joint degradation under repeated use. Mechanical fastening, while requiring additional design effort and assembly time, provided the most reliable enclosure integrity.
</p>
    <p>
Internal layout strategies were also explored during divergence, ranging from distributed component placement to structured and symmetrical arrangements. Distributed layouts offered flexibility during early prototyping but resulted in poor aesthetic coherence, reduced usability, and difficulty in reproducing the design. This thought process is seen through the SCAMPER and Classical Brainstorming.

    <h1 style="text-align:center;">Converging Notes:</h1>
    <h1 style="text-align:center;">Attachment of the Breadboard to Structure</h1>
    <p>Based on the divergence analysis, the mechanical fixation of the breadboard was selected as the final design approach.</p>

<p>Temporary fixation methods such as the use of tape or glue were rejected because they did not provide sufficient durability or consistent structural reliability under repeated handling.</p>

<p>Mechanical fastening was chosen because it best satisfied the structural requirement that internal components remain fixed during operation. Although this approach increased assembly complexity, the trade-off was justified by the significant improvement in mechanical stability, durability, and system reliability. Furthermore, a fixed breadboard position enhanced reproducibility by ensuring consistent component placement across builds.</p>

    <h1 style="text-align:center;">Attachment of the Top and Bottom Enclosure</h1>

<p>For the enclosure assembly, mechanical fastening using screws was selected as the final design solution.</p>

<p>Unfixed enclosure configurations were rejected due to poor structural integrity and the risk of separation during handling. Snap-fit assemblies, while aesthetically clean and lightweight, raised concerns relating to degradation over repeated use.</p>

<p>Mechanical fastening provided the highest level of enclosure stability and ensured that the internal components remained protected and immobile. This design choice aligned directly with the durability and safety requirements of the prototype. Although screw-based assembly required additional design effort and increased assembly time, it offered a more reliable and structurally stable solution, making it the optimal choice for the final prototype.</p>

    <h1 style="text-align:center;">Structural Layout of Components Within the Enclosure</h1>

<p>The structured and symmetrical layout was selected as the final configuration for component placement within the enclosure.</p>

<p>Distributed component placement was not ideal due to its negative impact on aesthetic coherence and reproducibility. Furthermore, this would not capture the full need for intuitive user interaction.</p>

<p>The structured and symmetrical layout was chosen because it balanced functionality, aesthetics, and usability. Buttons were positioned in intuitively accessible locations to facilitate user interaction, while LEDs were placed at the center to emphasize their role as visual indicators within the greenhouse model. Grouping related components improved clarity and ease of replication, and maintaining a flat, organized layout reduced visual clutter and mechanical instability.</p>

<p>Despite requiring multiple iterations to find the most appealing layout, our final layout best satisfied the design objectives of usability, aesthetic, and reproducibility. Therefore, it was selected as the final structural configuration.</p>
