    <h1 style="text-align:center;">Justification</h1>
<p>This section provides quantitative justification and analytical support for the converged design decisions, enabling evaluation of whether the proposed design satisfies the specified requirements prior to physical construction.
</p>
<p>    
A primary focus is the selection of LED resistor values, as these directly determine LED current and illumination intensity, a critical electrical specification (O-1.1-ELEC-1). This folder contains the mathematical analysis used to select appropriate resistance values, ensuring safe operation while achieving the desired visual output.
</p>
<p>
For the software subsystem, validation can be performed without constructing the physical prototype. Leveraging this advantage, extensive testing was conducted to verify that all software specifications were met, including the presence, reachability, and correctness of all system states. These tests ensured that the control logic behaves deterministically and satisfies the defined interaction requirements.
</p>
<p>
Finally, structural integrity was evaluated through targeted research into the properties of the chosen enclosure materials, PLA vs. plywood. This analysis examined tensile strength, thermal deformation characteristics, and material brittleness to assess suitability for the intended application. The folder includes a detailed write-up summarizing this research and its implications for the structural design. Through this research, it was determined that the material PLA would achieve greater structural integrity than plywood, when creating the prototype; thus suggesting a 3D print.
