    </h1>
    <p>
      The electrical subsystem underwent an extensive iterative prototyping process to refine component placement, user interaction, and overall functional reliability. Through eight successive prototypes, variations in LED positioning, button layout, and the number of input buttons were systematically explored to evaluate usability, wiring clarity, and spatial constraints imposed by the enclosure. Insights gained from each iteration directly informed subsequent revisions, ensuring that electrical design decisions were driven by empirical testing and integration considerations rather than assumption.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first electrical prototype represents an early-stage proof-of-concept focused on verifying basic circuit functionality and confirming correct LED operation. This iteration utilized a single input button positioned across the breadboard ravine, alongside the LEDs, to establish baseline system behavior before considering usability or layout optimization.

    <p>
      Building directly on the first prototype, the second iteration maintained a similar LED placement while introducing an additional input button. Through a process of divergence and convergence, this change explored improved user accessibility and control flexibility, highlighting the impact of input quantity on interaction design.

    <p>
      The third prototype investigated alternative LED placement strategies by relocating the LEDs from the breadboard ravine to the edge of the board. This adjustment opened new possibilities for enclosure design and spatial organization, demonstrating how electrical layout decisions influence structural constraints.

    <p>
      In this iteration, the LEDs were repositioned closer to the processor, enabling more efficient wiring paths and improved cable management. This prototype emphasized circuit cleanliness and highlighted the importance of layout optimization for both functionality and maintainability.

    </figure>

    <p>
      Prototype five introduced increased flexibility by disconnecting the LEDs from the main breadboard pins and reconnecting them using male-to-female jumper wires. This approach allowed for a greater range of motion in LED placement, supporting exploration of alternative enclosure geometries and mounting strategies.
    </p>

    </figure>

    <p>
      This iteration further refined wiring organization by modifying the resistor-to-LED connections. Rather than relying solely on breadboard traces, male-to-female wiring was employed to create cleaner and more deliberate connection paths, improving overall circuit clarity.

    </figure>

    <p>
      The seventh prototype explored a more unconventional configuration by removing the processor from direct attachment to the breadboard. Instead, the processor was connected exclusively using male-to-female jumper wires, freeing significant space on the breadboard and enabling greater flexibility in component arrangement.

    </figure>

    <p>
      The final electrical prototype served as a near-final validation model, consolidating insights from previous iterations. In this configuration, both buttons and LEDs were positioned across the breadboard ravine to maximize ease of access to inputs and outputs while maintaining a clean and organized layout.

  <p>
    The finalized electrical circuit closely resembles Prototype 8, incorporating additional refinements for usability and clarity. Button caps were added to improve tactile interaction, and wire lengths were trimmed to enhance cable management. Color-coded wiring was implemented, with red, green, and blue wires corresponding to the respective LEDs, black wires indicating ground connections, and white wires used for button inputs. These refinements improved readability and reduced the likelihood of wiring errors.

      The circuit schematic provides a two-dimensional representation of the finalized electrical design, serving as an online reference to clearly communicate component connectivity and system logic. Significant effort was made to simplify the physical circuit layout so that the schematic accurately reflects the real implementation, enabling straightforward analysis and verification directly from the final product.

    <h1 style="text-align:center;">Electrical Design Summary
    </h1>
    <p>
      The final electrical design directly evolved from insights gained across all eight prototypes. Prototype 1 established basic LED functionality, while Prototypes 2 and 3 explored alternative button layouts and LED positioning to optimize user accessibility. Prototypes 4 through 6 refined wiring organization and cable management, introducing male-to-female jumper connections that increased flexibility and clarity. Prototype 7’s unconventional processor placement freed space on the breadboard, enabling the compact arrangement adopted in the final model. Consolidating these learnings, the final design positioned both buttons and LEDs across the breadboard ravine, incorporated color-coded wiring, and included tactile button caps—creating a layout that maximized usability, readability, and integration with the structural enclosure.
