    <h1 style="text-align:center;">Integration Process Overview</h1>
    <p>
      This folder documents the integration of the electrical, software, and structural subsystems into
a complete Prototype System, with a focus on the challenges encountered and the iterative steps
taken to resolve them. Integration revealed several subsystem interactions that required targeted
debugging, redesign, and process-level adjustments before the system could reliably meet its intended functionality.
    </p>

    <p>
      At a structural level, integration progressed through two primary CAD designs. The initial
enclosure design revealed multiple fit and accessibility issues once the electrical subsystem was installed, including insufficient internal clearance and difficulty accessing inputs. A revised enclosure
design addressed these shortcomings through dimensional adjustments and interface refinements,
resulting in a structure that largely supported successful subsystem integration. However, additional iteration was required to ensure optimal function for this enclosure too. Evidence of both
versions, along with the specific changes made between them, is included in this folder.
    </p>

    <p>
      Electrical integration also exposed performance issues that were not apparent during isolated
subsystem testing. In particular, once the system was fully assembled and moved toward verification, the blue LED was observed to visually overpower the green LED under combined operation.
To correct this imbalance, resistor values were adjusted to better match perceived brightness across
LEDs. This change is documented through observations recorded during integration and verification.
    </p>

    <p>
Finally, this folder includes photos and videos of the fully integrated prototype system as built,
demonstrating the successful coordination of all three subsystems. Together, the artifacts in this
section show how early integration failures, debugging efforts, and design revisions ultimately converged into a functional prototype, while also identifying lessons that can inform future system
integration efforts.
