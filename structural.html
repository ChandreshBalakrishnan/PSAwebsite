    <h1 style="text-align:center;">Structural Design
    </h1>

    <p>
      The structural subsystem was developed through a series of iterative sketches and digital models to explore enclosure mechanisms, user accessibility, and physical stability. Early concepts emphasized basic containment and fastener-based assembly, while later iterations investigated alternative opening mechanisms, ergonomic considerations, and improved interaction with the electrical components. These explorations informed two converged CAD designs, each validated through corresponding CAM models to assess manufacturability.
    </p>

    <p>
      The first enclosure sketch represents an initial baseline concept, utilizing four screws to secure the case. Openings for the LEDs and buttons were positioned along the breadboard ravine, aligning the user interface directly with the electrical layout. This concept prioritized simplicity and ease of fabrication, serving as a reference point for subsequent iterations.

    </figure>

    <p>
      The second sketch maintains the four-screw fastening strategy but relocates the LED and button openings to the side of the breadboard. This iteration explored alternative user interaction angles and assessed how component placement could influence overall enclosure geometry and accessibility.

    </figure>

    <p>
      Sketch three introduces a hinged enclosure mechanism with an integrated handle, allowing the case to open and close without complete disassembly. The LEDs and button opening return to the ravine, combining improved accessibility for internal components with an enhanced user interaction model. This iteration explored convenience and maintainability as key design drivers.

    <p>
      The fourth sketch proposes a sliding insertion mechanism, where the breadboard is inserted into the enclosure rather than enclosed through fastening. Openings for the LEDs and buttons are again aligned with the ravine. This concept investigates modularity and ease of assembly, reducing reliance on external fasteners.

    <p>
      Sketch five explores a snap-fit enclosure, in which two parts of the case interlock to form a closed box. This iteration focuses on rapid assembly and minimal hardware, evaluating the feasibility of friction-based retention for a compact electronic enclosure.

    <p>
      The final sketch returns to a four-screw design with openings for the LEDs and buttons positioned along the ravine, but introduces integrated legs at the base of the enclosure. These legs improve stability and elevate the device, addressing ergonomic and surface-contact considerations identified in earlier concepts.

    <p>
      Two CAD models were developed and validated through corresponding CAM simulations to converge on a manufacturable enclosure design.

The first CAD and CAM model pair corresponds directly to Sketch 6. This version translates the sketched concept into a precise digital model, confirming component fit, fastener placement, and the effectiveness of the integrated legs.

The second CAD and CAM model pair represents an evolved version of the same design. While retaining the overall structure and leg features from Sketch 6, the enclosure width and height were increased to improve internal clearance. Additionally, the button interface was refined by incorporating button caps rather than simple cutouts, enhancing both usability and visual clarity. This final iteration reflects a convergence of functional, ergonomic, and aesthetic considerations.

      In addition to the CAD and CAM files, the orders for these two breadboard cases were processed and produced via the MyFAB 3D printers, and created two physical designs we were able to analyze and test.

    <p>
      The final enclosure reflects cumulative decisions from all six sketches and CAD/CAM iterations. Sketches 1 and 2 informed basic button and LED placement and the four-screw assembly strategy, while Sketch 3 introduced a hinged opening concept for better accessibility. Sketch 4 tested modular insertion, and Sketch 5 explored snap-fit assembly for rapid closure. Sketch 6’s integrated legs and revised cutouts directly shaped the CAD model that became the final design. The resulting enclosure retains the four-screw structure, incorporates elevated legs for stability, and aligns button and LED openings precisely over the breadboard ravine, fully accommodating the final electrical layout and supporting intuitive user interaction as guided by the software design.
