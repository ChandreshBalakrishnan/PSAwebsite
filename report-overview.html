    <h1>Prototype System Overview (Folder 04_Prototype)</h1>

    <p>
      This prototype exemplifies a single module of an embedded greenhouse lighting system designed to change light color in response to user input. The system integrates a software control subsystem responsible for managing system behavior (Section 2), an electrical subsystem that interfaces user inputs and LED outputs (Section 3), and a digitally fabricated structural enclosure that houses and protects the system components (Section 4). The prototype was developed in accordance with the defined specifications and design constraints. System performance was evaluated against the specifications using a structured verification framework, as documented in Section 6.
    </p>

    <h1>Software Subsystem (Folder 04.2.2_Software)</h1>

    <p>
      The software subsystem is implemented in CircuitPython on the Raspberry Pi Pico and realizes the system’s control logic based on a finite state machine (FSM) model, shown below.
