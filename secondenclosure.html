    <h1 style="text-align:center;">Second Enclosure Iteration: Structural and Interface Refinements</h1>
    <p>
      Clearances in the revised enclosure model were increased to improve ease of both disassembly and
reassembly. In this iteration, the alignment divots were removed entirely, as they required an
unnecessary level of dimensional precision while providing minimal functional benefit. However,
eliminating the divots necessitated an alternative method for constraining the breadboard in order
to satisfy specification O-4.2-STRU-1.
    </p>

    <p>
      Vertical movement of the breadboard was constrained using tape, while horizontal motion was
effectively prevented by the enclosure geometry itself; the simple rectangular cavity provided sufficient lateral confinement without additional features. This approach reduced assembly complexity
while maintaining adequate positional stability during operation.
    </p>

    <p>
      Additionally, a new button actuation mechanism was introduced to eliminate the previously
problematic structural wall that had interfered with internal components. This design employs
a flexible button extension mechanism that allows the button to be actuated from a range of
heights. Conceptually, a slender vertical tube extends downward from the enclosure surface and
is thinly attached to the surrounding structure. The attachment is sufficiently flexible to allow
bending under finger pressure, enabling reliable button actuation without fracture. The image
section_view_button.png shows a section view CAD screenshot of this proposed mechanism.
    </p>

    <p>
      This mechanism did not function as intended, primarily because the PLA material was significantly stiffer than anticipated. As a result, the button extension did not deform sufficiently
under applied force to reliably actuate the button. To debug this issue, the button extenders were
separated from the enclosure and instead attached directly to the buttons themselves.
    </p>
    
  <p>
    In future iterations, this issue could be avoided by printing the button caps as separate components from the outset and attaching them during assembly. Alternatively, the button interface
could be redesigned such that the printed button extension is not mechanically attached to the
enclosure at all. In this approach, a small clearance gap would be maintained between the button
extension and the surrounding case walls, allowing the extension to rest freely above the button and
transmit force through direct contact rather than elastic deformation. This would reduce reliance on material flexibility while preserving consistent button actuation.
  </p>

    <p>
      The file buttoncap_glue.mov documents the process of gluing the button cap directly onto the
button. The decision to use adhesive bonding was informed by discussions with MyFab staff, who
advised that glue would provide a more reliable attachment method than tapes such as Scotch
or duct tape. This approach was deemed acceptable given that the buttons were final-sale components, eliminating concerns about potential damage to shared or reusable parts. The file circuit_building_with_buttoncap.mov shows the subsequent rebuilding of the circuit with the modified
button assemblies.
