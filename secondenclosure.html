    <h1 style="text-align:center;">Second Enclosure Iteration: Structural and Interface Refinements</h1>
    <p>
      Clearances in the revised enclosure model were increased to improve ease of both disassembly and
reassembly. In this iteration, the alignment divots were removed entirely, as they required an
unnecessary level of dimensional precision while providing minimal functional benefit. However,
eliminating the divots necessitated an alternative method for constraining the breadboard in order
to satisfy specification O-4.2-STRU-1.
    </p>

    <p>
      Vertical movement of the breadboard was constrained using tape, while horizontal motion was
effectively prevented by the enclosure geometry itself; the simple rectangular cavity provided sufficient lateral confinement without additional features. This approach reduced assembly complexity
while maintaining adequate positional stability during operation.
    </p>

    <p>
      Additionally, a new button actuation mechanism was introduced to eliminate the previously
problematic structural wall that had interfered with internal components. This design employs
a flexible button extension mechanism that allows the button to be actuated from a range of
heights. Conceptually, a slender vertical tube extends downward from the enclosure surface and
is thinly attached to the surrounding structure. The attachment is sufficiently flexible to allow
bending under finger pressure, enabling reliable button actuation without fracture. The image
section_view_button.png shows a section view CAD screenshot of this proposed mechanism.
