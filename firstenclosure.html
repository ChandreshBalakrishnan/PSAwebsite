    <h1 style="text-align:center;">First Enclosure Iteration: Design and Integration Issues</h1>
    <p>
      The file old_case_fit_issue.mov documents the inability of the breadboard to fully fit within the
designed enclosure. This issue arose from two primary factors. First, one of the breadboard
support divots was slightly mispositioned, preventing proper insertion of the breadboard into the
case. Second, a structural region intended to separate the button interface from the wiring extended
too far into the enclosure volume, interfering with the microprocessor. As a result, the breadboard
could not sit flush within the case when nearly fully inserted.
    </p>

  <p>
    This issue was addressed through a combination of minor post-processing modifications. The
mispositioned divot was sanded to increase its effective diameter, allowing it to accept the corresponding breadboard divot and enabling proper insertion. This approach would not be practical if
the misalignment were significant; however, the deviation was sufficiently small to permit corrective
sanding. To prevent similar issues in future iterations, more precise dimensional measurements can be taken during design, or the use of alignment divots can be eliminated altogether, as was done
in the second iteration of the enclosure design.
  </p>

  <p>
    To resolve the overextension issue, pliers were used to carefully remove a portion of the interfering structural wall until adequate clearance for the microprocessor was achieved. This issue could
have been avoided with more careful measurements.
  </p>

    The file old_case_modifications.HEIC shows a work-in-progress image of these modifications,
while old_case_ready.png documents the completed result. Notably, the sanded divot edge is labeled
(1), and the removed wall sections are labeled (2).

    <p>
      While this enclosure was functionally usable, several integration issues remained. The file
old_case_assembly_issue.mov shows that assembly was difficult due to the extremely tight fit between the breadboard and the enclosure, requiring the board to be forcibly inserted. As a result,
disassembly was also challenging, as the breadboard had to be pushed out with force, with the
USB-B opening being the only available point of leverage. This made routine access and servicing
difficult and, in general, hindered compliance with specification O-3.1-STRU-3.

  <p>
    Additionally, the image old_case_tight_button.HEIC shows that the button actuation opening
was only marginally large enough for a finger, resulting in uncomfortable and unreliable user interaction. Due to these remaining structural and usability issues, a new CAD model was developed
to iterate on enclosure clearances, assembly tolerances, and button interface geometry.
