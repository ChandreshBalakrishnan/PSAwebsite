    <h1 style="text-align:center;">Converging Notes</h1>
    <h1 style="text-align:center;">Selection of FSM-Based Control Logic</h1>

<p>The finite-state machine (FSM) architecture was selected as the final control strategy.
Sequential cycling control was not chosen due to its inefficiency in state navigation and limited interaction capability.
</p>

<p>    
The FSM approach provided clear state definitions and deterministic transitions, aligning with the project requirement for predictable system behavior. Although it introduced additional software complexity, the benefits in usability and system clarity justified this trade-off.
</p>
    
    <h1 style="text-align:center;">Selection of Two-Button Control Scheme</h1>

<p>The two-button input configuration was selected as the final design choice.
The single-button approach was rejected due to its inability to support efficient bidirectional navigation between states.</p>

<p>The two-button scheme enabled users to transition between any system states with minimal interaction, directly supporting the FSM architecture. Despite increasing hardware complexity, this configuration significantly improved user experience and control efficiency.</p>

    <h1 style="text-align:center;">Selection of Structured Circuit Layout</h1>

<p>A structured and symmetrical circuit layout was selected as the final electrical configuration.
Distributed wiring layouts were rejected due to reduced readability and reproducibility.</p>

<p>The structured layout improved debugging efficiency, minimized wiring errors, and facilitated replication of the circuit design. Furthermore, maintaining a flat and organized component arrangement enhanced both aesthetic coherence and mechanical stability within the enclosure.</p>

<p>Despite requiring additional planning, this layout best satisfied the design objectives of clarity, reliability, and reproducibility.</p>
