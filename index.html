    <h1 style="text-align:center;">Prototype System Overview</h1>

    <p>
      This prototype exemplifies a single module of an embedded greenhouse lighting system, modelled using the finite state machine (FSM) in Figure 1.
    </p>

the LED system controlled by two buttons.

    </figure>

    <p>
      The FSM defines three operating states: <strong>OFF</strong>
(all LEDs off), <strong>PLANTS</strong> (red and blue LEDs
on), and <strong>PLANTS & PEOPLE</strong> (all LEDs on).
System behavior is controlled through two push-
button inputs, <strong>Forward</strong> and <strong>Backward</strong>, which
cyclically advance or reverse the system state.
The <strong>Reset</strong> input indicates the system’s initial
state.

    <h1 style="text-align:center;">Software Subsystem</h1>

    <p>
      The software subsystem implements the finite
state machine described above using Circuit-
Python on the Raspberry Pi Pico. Iterations
informing the final control architecture are doc-
umented in Folder 04.2.2_Software.
    </p>

    <h1 style="text-align:center;">Electrical Subsystem</h1>

    <p>
      The electrical subsystem provides the interface
between the software control logic and the phys-
ical system. It is shown in Figure 2:

    <p>
      Resistor values of 220 Ω, 1000 Ω, and 330 Ω were
selected for the red, blue, and green LEDs re-
spectively to prevent LED damage and achieve
balanced perceived brightness, with final adjust-
ments informed during integration. The final cir-
cuit layout was refined through multiple itera-
tions, documented in Folder 04.2.1_Electrical.
    </p>

    <h1 style="text-align:center;">Electrical Subsystem</h1>
    <p>
      The electrical subsystem consists of a Raspberry Pi Pico, LEDs, resistors, and two pushbuttons on a breadboard. Resistors were selected to prevent LED damage, cross-referencing Lab 2 and observation of brightness through trials. The final circuitry design was selected to minimize the use of wires, and keep LEDs centered design for cleanliness, aesthetics, and reproducibility.

    <h1 style="text-align:center;">Structural Subsystem</h1>
    <p>
      The final structural subsystem consists of a digitally fabricated enclosure designed to protect the electrical components and improve aesthetic appeal. PLA was selected due to MYFab fabrication constraints. The enclosure design prioritized accessibility to the pushbutton and USB port while minimizing material usage and print time. Screws were used to secure the enclosure to design for durability. Further iterations can be found in Folder 04.2.2_Structural.
