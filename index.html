    <h1 style="text-align:center;">Prototype System Overview</h1>

    <p>
      This prototype exemplifies a single module of an embedded greenhouse lighting system, modelled using the finite state machine (FSM) in Figure 1.
    </p>

the LED system controlled by two buttons.
      </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      The FSM defines three operating states: <strong>OFF</strong>
(all LEDs off), <strong>PLANTS</strong> (red and blue LEDs
on), and <strong>PLANTS & PEOPLE</strong> (all LEDs on).
System behavior is controlled through two push-
button inputs, <strong>Forward</strong> and <strong>Backward</strong>, which
cyclically advance or reverse the system state.
The <strong>Reset</strong> input indicates the system’s initial
state.
    </p>

    <h1 style="text-align:center;">Software Subsystem</h1>

    <p>
      The software subsystem implements the finite
state machine described above using Circuit-
Python on the Raspberry Pi Pico. Iterations
informing the final control architecture are documented in Folder 04.2.2_Software.
    </p>

    <h1 style="text-align:center;">Electrical Subsystem</h1>

    <p>
      The electrical subsystem provides the interface
between the software control logic and the physical system. It is shown in Figure 2.
    </p>

    </figure>

    <p>
      Resistor values of 220 Ω, 1000 Ω, and 330 Ω were
selected for the red, blue, and green LEDs respectively to prevent LED damage and achieve
balanced perceived brightness, with final adjustments informed during integration. The final circuit layout was refined through multiple iterations, documented in Folder 04.2.1_Electrical.
    </p>

    <h1 style="text-align:center;">Structural Subsystem</h1>
    <p>
      The structural subsystem protects the electrical
components while improving the aesthetics of the
prototype. It is shown in Figure 3.
    </p>

    </figure>

    <p>
      The enclosure was designed using CAD tools and
fabricated using PLA via 3D printing at MyFab.
The final design provides access to the pushbuttons and USB port, and is fastened using screws
for reliable assembly and disassembly. The structural design evolved through multiple iterations,
documented in Folder 04.2.2_Structural.
    </p>

    <h1 style="text-align:center;">Integrated Prototype</h1>
    <p>
The final prototype integrates the software, electrical, and structural subsystems into a single functional unit, as shown in Figure 4.
    </p>

    <h1 style="text-align:center;">Major Challenges Faced</h1>
    <p>
      Several challenges emerged during system integration that were not apparent during isolated subsystem development. The initial enclosure iteration prevented the breadboard from fully seating due to mispositioned alignment divots and an overextended internal wall, highlighting the need to account for enclosure tolerances and internal clearances earlier in the design process. These lessons were directly applied in a subsequent CAD iteration, which incorporated increased clearances, removal of divots, and other refinements that resolved the structural issues.
    </p>

    <p>
      Integration also revealed a brightness imbalance between the blue and green LEDs during combined operation, leading to an adjustment of the blue LED resistor value to improve visual consistency. Artifacts documenting these challenges and the iterative integration process are provided in Folder 04.3_Integration.
    </p>

    <h1 style="text-align:center;">Prototype Performance</h1>
    <p>
      A verification framework was created to assess
the prototype’s performance against the specification. This framework and detailed testing artifacts are found in Folder 04.4_Verification. The
prototype met all the specifications; an example of verification is outlined below.
    </p>

    <p>
      A key structural requirement verified was that
      internal components remain fixed relative to the
      enclosure during handling and operation. The
      assembled prototype was subjected to manual
      translation and rotation in multiple orientations,
      after which the position of a reference component
      was measured relative to the enclosure walls.
      Positional differences before and after testing
      were recorded in a verification spreadsheet and
      compared against a ±0.5 mm tolerance, chosen
      based on the minimum perceptible distance of
      the human eye. All measured displacements were
      within tolerance, confirming that the enclosure
      adequately constrained the electrical subsystem
      during normal operation.
    </p>

    <h1 style="text-align:center;">Key Design Decisions</h1>
    <p>
      • <strong>Screwed enclosure:</strong> Screws were chosen over
      snap-fit mechanisms to ensure reliable retention despite print tolerances, while allowing repeated assembly and disassembly for servicing.
    </p>
    <p>
      • <strong>LED placement:</strong> LEDs were placed symmetrically and centered to improve visual balance
      and clearly convey system states.
    </p>
    <p>
      • <strong>Forward/Backward button architecture:</strong>
      A bidirectional control scheme was selected so
      every state is reachable from any other state,
      improving usability and ensuring full state accessibility.
    </p>
      • <strong>Button caps:</strong> Button caps were used instead of exposed pushbuttons to address poor
      ergonomics observed in the first prototype,
      where limited finger clearance could not be improved due to circuit constraints.
