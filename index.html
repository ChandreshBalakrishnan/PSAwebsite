    <h1 style="text-align:center;">Prototype System Overview</h1>

    <p>
      This prototype exemplifies a single module of an embedded greenhouse lighting system, modelled using the finite state machine (FSM) in Figure 1.
    </p>

the LED system controlled by two buttons.

    </figure>

    <p>
      The FSM defines three operating states: <strong>OFF</strong>
(all LEDs off), <strong>PLANTS</strong> (red and blue LEDs
on), and <strong>PLANTS & PEOPLE</strong> (all LEDs on).
System behavior is controlled through two push-
button inputs, <strong>Forward</strong> and <strong>Backward</strong>, which
cyclically advance or reverse the system state.
The <strong>Reset</strong> input indicates the system’s initial
state.
    </p>

    <h1 style="text-align:center;">Software Subsystem</h1>

    <p>
      The software subsystem implements the finite
state machine described above using Circuit-
Python on the Raspberry Pi Pico. Iterations
informing the final control architecture are documented in Folder 04.2.2_Software.
    </p>

    <h1 style="text-align:center;">Electrical Subsystem</h1>

    <p>
      The electrical subsystem provides the interface
between the software control logic and the physical system. It is shown in Figure 2.
    </p>

    </figure>

    <p>
      Resistor values of 220 Ω, 1000 Ω, and 330 Ω were
selected for the red, blue, and green LEDs respectively to prevent LED damage and achieve
balanced perceived brightness, with final adjustments informed during integration. The final circuit layout was refined through multiple iterations, documented in Folder 04.2.1_Electrical.
    </p>

    <h1 style="text-align:center;">Structural Subsystem</h1>
    <p>
      The structural subsystem protects the electrical
components while improving the aesthetics of the
prototype. It is shown in Figure 3.
    </p>

    </figure>

    <p>
      The enclosure was designed using CAD tools and
fabricated using PLA via 3D printing at MyFab.
The final design provides access to the pushbuttons and USB port, and is fastened using screws
for reliable assembly and disassembly. The structural design evolved through multiple iterations,
documented in Folder 04.2.2_Structural.
    </p>

    <h1 style="text-align:center;">Integrated Prototype</h1>
    <p>
The final prototype integrates the software, electrical, and structural subsystems into a single functional unit, as shown in Figure 4.
