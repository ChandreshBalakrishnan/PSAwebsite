          <td>Demonstrate that there is a visual distinction between the OFF state and the PLANTS & PEOPLE state in an ambient light (outdoor environment between sunup and sundown), or brighter (such as a well-lit room). Metric: PASS/FAIL</td>
          <td>Verification was conducted using two videos. Video O-1.1-ELEC-1-1.mov, recorded outdoors under ambient lighting conditions, shows the system cycling through all three states twice; the OFF and PLANTS & PEOPLE states are visually distinguishable. Video O-1.1-ELEC-1-2.mov, recorded in a well-lit indoor environment at MyFab, shows a transition from the OFF state to the PLANTS & PEOPLE state with clear visual distinction. The requirement is therefore met. PASS.</td>
          <td>Testing was conducted in both ambient light and artificial light environments. This ensures that the prototype meets the requirement, even if the outdoor environment is not particularly bright at the time of the demonstration, due to weather.</td>
