    <h1 style="text-align:center;">Prototype Design Process Overview</h1>
    <p>
      This document describes the contents of the Prototype Design Folder and outlines the design methodology used to develop the final system. The design process followed a structured diverging and converging approach across three subsystems: electrical, software, and structural. 
    </p>
    <p>
For each subsystem, divergence was achieved through the application of the SCAMPER method, generating multiple design concepts by systematically challenging initial assumptions. Convergence was then achieved through pairwise comparison, where the proposed prototypes were evaluated against one another to determine the most effective solution based on usability, functionality, and integration constraints.
    </p>
    <p>
    The folder therefore contains six key artifacts:
    </p>
    <p>
• Three SCAMPER analyses (one per subsystem) representing the diverging phase
    </p>
    <p>
• Two Classical Brainstorming files for electrical and structural subsystems representing the
diverging phase
    </p>
    <p>
• Three pairwise comparison analyses (one per subsystem) representing the converging phase
    <p>
• Two Converging Notes files for electrical and structural subsystems representing the converging phase
    </p>
